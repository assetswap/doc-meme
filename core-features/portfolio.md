# Portfolio Management

Your portfolio dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your token holdings and trading performance. Access it from the main navigation to monitor your investments in real-time. Trade directly through [AI Chat](ai-chat.md) or set up [automated strategies](../automation/autopilot.md) to manage your portfolio 24/7.

## Portfolio Overview

### Key Metrics Dashboard

At the top of your portfolio, you'll find four essential metrics that summarize your current position:

| Metric | Description | What It Shows |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Total Value** | Current USD value of all holdings | Your portfolio's worth right now |
| **24h Change** | Daily profit/loss as percentage | How you're performing today |
| **Total P&L** | All-time profit or loss | Your overall trading success |
| **Token Count** | Number of different tokens held | Portfolio diversification level |

### Token Holdings Display

Your individual token holdings are presented in a comprehensive table format. Each token row shows its symbol with logo, the quantity you hold, current USD value, and performance metrics. The 24-hour change helps you spot today's movers, while your personal P&L shows profit or loss since you purchased that specific token. The allocation percentage reveals how much of your portfolio each token represents, helping you maintain proper diversification.

## Performance Visualization

### Understanding the Profit Chart

The portfolio includes an interactive profit chart that tracks your performance over time. You can switch between different time periods (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or all-time) to analyze your trading patterns. Green areas indicate portfolio growth periods, while red shows declines. Individual trade points appear as dots on the chart, allowing you to correlate specific actions with performance changes.

### Interactive Features

The chart responds to your interactions for deeper analysis. Hovering over any point reveals exact values and timestamps. You can zoom in on specific periods using pinch gestures on mobile or scroll wheel on desktop. Clicking on trade dots opens detailed information about that transaction. Export functionality lets you download your performance data for external analysis or record-keeping.

## Token Management

### Quick Actions

Each token in your portfolio comes with a set of quick action buttons for efficient management. You can instantly trade to adjust your position through [AI Chat](ai-chat.md), view detailed price charts on the [Dashboard](dashboard.md) for technical analysis, set custom [price alerts](../automation/alerts.md) for important levels, or add the token to [automated tasks](../automation/scheduled-tasks.md) for hands-free trading.

### Sorting and Organization

The portfolio view offers multiple sorting options to help you focus on what matters most. Sort by value to see your largest holdings at the top, by performance to identify today's winners and losers, by recent activity to track new purchases, or alphabetically for easy navigation.

## Performance Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators

Your trading performance is measured through three critical metrics:

| Metric | Description | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Win Rate** | Percentage of profitable trades | Above 60% indicates strong trading decisions |
| **Average Return** | Mean profit per completed trade | Helps set realistic profit targets and position sizes |
| **Best Trade** | Your highest single profit | Analyze to replicate successful strategies |

## Risk Assessment

### Portfolio Diversification Analysis

The platform automatically calculates your diversification score based on token distribution and correlation. A score between 0-30 indicates dangerous concentration in too few assets. Scores from 30-70 represent a balanced approach suitable for most traders. Anything above 70 shows excellent diversification but may dilute potential gains.

### Risk Classification

Your portfolio risk level is determined by analyzing token volatility, market cap distribution, and position sizes. Low risk portfolios consist primarily of established tokens with modest position sizes. Medium risk involves a healthy mix of blue-chip and emerging tokens. High risk portfolios are weighted toward new, volatile tokens with larger position sizes.

### AI-Powered Recommendations

The system continuously analyzes your portfolio to provide actionable insights. These include optimal rebalancing suggestions based on market conditions, profit-taking alerts when tokens reach significant gains, and risk warnings if your portfolio becomes too concentrated or exposed to correlated assets.
