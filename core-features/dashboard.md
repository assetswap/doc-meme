## Token Scoring System

### How Tokens Are Scored

Our AI analyzes multiple factors to score each token from 0-100:

#### On-Chain Metrics (40% weight)
- **Holder Distribution**: Are holders diverse or concentrated?
- **Wallet Quality**: Ratio of profitable wallets vs loss-making wallets
- **Transaction Patterns**: Natural growth vs artificial pumping
- **Liquidity Depth**: Available liquidity relative to market cap
- **Smart Money Activity**: Tracking known profitable wallets

#### Off-Chain Signals (30% weight)
- **Social Sentiment**: Twitter mentions, engagement rates
- **Influencer Activity**: Who's talking about the token
- **Community Growth**: Discord/Telegram member growth
- **News & Events**: Upcoming catalysts or concerns
- **Fake News Detection**: Filtering hype from reality

#### Technical Indicators (30% weight)
- **Price Action**: Not traditional TA, but momentum patterns
- **Volume Analysis**: Real vs wash trading detection
- **Buy/Sell Pressure**: Order flow imbalance
- **Volatility Patterns**: Risk assessment
- **Correlation Analysis**: Movement relative to SOL/market

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Strong buy signal, multiple positive factors |
| 60-79 | Good | Positive outlook, worth considering |
| 40-59 | Neutral | Mixed signals, higher risk |
