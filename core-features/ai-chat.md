# AI Chat Assistant

The AI chat assistant transforms complex trading into simple conversations. Just type what you want in natural language, and the AI handles the technical details.

## How It Works

Using the AI assistant is straightforward. Type your request in the chat box and press Enter. The AI responds immediately with relevant information or action confirmations. For any trades, you'll see a confirmation prompt before execution. The entire process eliminates the need for navigating complex trading interfaces.

## Command Categories

### Trading Operations

The AI understands various trading commands in natural language:

| Command Type | Example | What Happens |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| **Simple Buy** | "Buy $100 of BONK" | Purchases exact amount |
| **Full Sell** | "Sell all my WIF" | Liquidates entire position |
| **Smart Buy** | "Buy the top trending token" | Analyzes and executes |
| **Partial Sell** | "Sell 50% of everything" | Reduces all positions by half |

### Information Queries

Get instant market insights and portfolio data through conversational queries. Ask about your portfolio to see current holdings and performance. Check token prices for real-time market data. Monitor your profit/loss across all positions. Discover trending tokens based on volume and price action.

### Automation Setup

Configure automated trading strategies using simple commands. Set up autopilot mode for hands-free trading based on AI recommendations. Schedule recurring purchases like daily dollar-cost averaging. Create price alerts for significant market movements. Implement stop-loss orders to protect against downside risk.

## Intelligent Features

### Understanding Your Context

The AI remembers what you've been talking about during your session. For example, if you ask "What's trending today?" and get a list of popular tokens, you can simply say "Buy the first one" without having to repeat which token you mean. The assistant keeps track of your conversation and understands what you're referring to, just like talking to a helpful friend.

### Speaking Naturally

You don't need to learn special commands or technical terms. The AI understands everyday language and common phrases. When you say "buy more," it knows to repeat your last purchase. Saying "double it" increases your position by twice the amount. If you change your mind and say "actually nevermind," it cancels what you were about to do. This makes trading feel like having a normal conversation instead of typing rigid computer commands.

### Multi-Tab Conversations

You can maintain multiple independent chat sessions simultaneously. Each tab preserves its own context and history, allowing you to research tokens in one tab while executing trades in another. This separation helps organize complex trading strategies without confusion.

## Optimization Strategies

### Communication Best Practices

For optimal results, provide specific details in your requests. Instead of vague commands like "buy some crypto," specify exact amounts and tokens: "Buy $100 of BONK." This precision ensures accurate execution and reduces confirmation steps.

### Quick Input Methods

The AI recognizes shortcuts like typing "100" to buy $100 worth of the last discussed token, "BONK" to check its price, or "again" to repeat your last action.

### Educational Queries

Beyond trading, the AI serves as your educational resource. Ask about trading concepts like slippage, request market analysis, or seek explanations about specific tokens. The assistant provides clear, actionable information to improve your trading knowledge.

## Practical Examples

The AI understands both trading and research commands naturally. For trading, you can execute quick buys ("Buy $50 BONK"), full exits ("Sell everything"), token swaps ("Swap BONK for WIF"), or set conditional orders ("Buy if BONK drops 20%"). View all your trades in your [Portfolio](portfolio.md) or set up similar rules in [Autopilot](../automation/autopilot.md).

For research, ask comparative questions ("Compare BONK vs WIF"), discover opportunities ("Show me new tokens") through [Market Discovery](market-discovery.md), or track smart money ("What are whales buying?"). The AI provides comprehensive analysis based on real-time market data from our [Dashboard](dashboard.md).

## Safety Protocols

The platform implements multiple safety layers to protect your trades. Every transaction requires explicit confirmation before execution, displaying the exact amount and estimated fees. The system provides risk warnings for volatile tokens or large positions. Most importantly, no trades execute without your direct approval, ensuring you maintain complete control.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Connection Issues

If the AI isn't responding, first verify your internet connection is stable. Try refreshing the page to reset the chat session. If problems persist, wait a moment and retry your command.

### Interpretation Problems

When the AI misunderstands your request, provide more specific details. Always include dollar signs for USD amounts and token symbols for clarity. Adding context like "I want to buy" or "check the price" helps the AI understand your intent.

### Transaction Failures

Failed trades usually stem from insufficient balance. Ensure you have enough SOL for gas fees (typically 0.01-0.05 SOL per transaction). If large trades fail, try smaller amounts or check if the token has adequate liquidity.

## Key Principle

Natural conversation yields best results. The AI adapts to your communication style, making trading as simple as having a conversation.
