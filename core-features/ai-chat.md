### Quick Commands
Speed up trading with shortcuts:
- Numbers only = dollar amounts ("100" = buy $100)
- Token symbols = quick price check ("BONK")
- "Again" = repeat last action

### Follow-Up Questions
The AI remembers context:
```
You: "What's trending?"
AI: [Shows trending tokens]
You: "Buy the top one"
AI: [Executes trade]
```
