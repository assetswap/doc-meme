# Fee schedule

### ðŸ’¸ Fee Schedule

At AssetSwap, we believe in transparency and performance-based rewards. Our trading fees adapt based on your activity and loyalty tier, so the more you trade or hold A7X tokens, the more you save.

#### ðŸ”¹ Standard Trading Fees

By default, all users start with a **2.5% trading fee** on executed swaps and transactions. This fee helps cover protocol operations, liquidity access, and AI service layers.
