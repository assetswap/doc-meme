# Swap

The swap feature enables instant cryptocurrency exchanges directly within your portfolio. Convert between any supported tokens with transparent pricing and immediate settlement.

## Understanding Token Swaps

Token swapping provides a seamless way to rebalance your portfolio or take advantage of market opportunities. Unlike traditional exchanges that require multiple trading pairs and order books, our swap feature connects directly to decentralized liquidity pools for optimal pricing and instant execution.

## How Swapping Works

Initiate a swap through natural conversation with the AI assistant. The system guides you through selecting tokens, confirming amounts, and reviewing exchange rates before execution. Simply state your intention like "swap BTC for ETH" or type "swap" to begin the interactive process.

## Step-by-Step Exchange Process

The swap workflow ensures clarity at every step. First, specify the token you're swapping from and the amount. Next, choose your desired token to receive. The system calculates the exchange rate based on current market conditions, displays the exact amount you'll receive, and confirms your balance before proceeding.

## Real Swap Conversation

Here's how a typical swap interaction progresses:

| Stage | Interaction | Details |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Initiation** | User: "swap" | Starts the swap process |
| **Source Token** | System: "What coin are you swapping?"<br>User: "BTC" | Identifies token to exchange |
| **Amount** | System: "How much BTC?"<br>User: "0.5" | Specifies quantity |
| **Target Token** | System: "What coin do you want?"<br>User: "ETH" | Selects destination token |
| **Confirmation** | System: "You'll receive 10.8 ETH for 0.5 BTC" | Shows exchange details |
| **Execution** | System: "Swap complete!" | Confirms transaction |

## Balance Verification

The platform automatically verifies your token balance before processing swaps. If you have insufficient tokens, it calculates the exact shortfall and provides options. For instance, attempting to swap 1 BTC when you hold 0.1 BTC triggers: "Insufficient BTC. You have 0.1 BTC but need 1 BTC. Would you like to swap a smaller amount?"

## Swap Advantages

Direct pool access eliminates intermediaries and reduces fees. Real-time pricing ensures you receive current market rates. The conversational interface makes complex DeFi operations accessible to everyone. Instant settlement means your new tokens appear immediately in your portfolio.

## Important Considerations

Always review the exchange rate and output amount before confirming. Market volatility can affect rates between quote and execution. Check your portfolio balance to ensure sufficient tokens for the swap. Consider gas fees when swapping smaller amounts.
