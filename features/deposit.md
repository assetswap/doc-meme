# Deposit

Fund your AssetSwap wallet to start trading, swapping, and investing in cryptocurrencies. Multiple deposit methods ensure you can add funds conveniently and securely.

## Understanding Deposits

Deposits are the gateway to your trading journey on AssetSwap. Whether you're adding your first funds or topping up an existing balance, the platform supports various cryptocurrencies and payment methods. Your deposited funds remain in your control, ready for instant trading or withdrawal at any time.

## Deposit Methods

### Cryptocurrency Deposits

The most common method involves transferring existing crypto to your AssetSwap wallet. The platform supports all major cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, and hundreds of tokens. Each deposit generates a unique address specific to the cryptocurrency you're depositing, ensuring secure and accurate crediting.

### Card Payments

For newcomers to crypto, direct card purchases offer the simplest onboarding. Link your debit or credit card to instantly convert fiat currency to cryptocurrency. The system partners with regulated payment processors to ensure security and compliance. Card deposits typically complete within 1-3 minutes during business hours.

## Step-by-Step Deposit Process

### Initiating a Crypto Deposit

Start by typing "deposit" in the AI chat or clicking the deposit button in your wallet. Specify which cryptocurrency you want to deposit and the approximate amount. The system generates a unique deposit address for that specific cryptocurrency. Double-check the address before sending to avoid loss of funds.

### Sending Your Funds

Copy the provided deposit address carefully, ensuring no characters are missed or changed. Navigate to your external wallet or exchange where your funds are currently held. Initiate a withdrawal or send transaction to your AssetSwap deposit address. Include any required memo or tag if specified for certain cryptocurrencies.

## Deposit Confirmation Process

| Stage | Timeline | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Detection** | 0-30 seconds | System detects incoming transaction |
| **Pending** | 1-10 minutes | Transaction awaits network confirmations |
| **Processing** | 2-15 minutes | Confirmations accumulate based on network |
| **Completed** | Final | Funds appear in your wallet |

## Network Confirmation Requirements

Different blockchains require varying confirmation counts for security:

| Cryptocurrency | Confirmations | Typical Time |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Bitcoin** | 3 confirmations | 30-60 minutes |
| **Ethereum** | 12 confirmations | 2-5 minutes |
| **Solana** | 1 confirmation | 1-2 seconds |
| **USDC** | 12 confirmations | 2-5 minutes |

## Important Security Considerations

### Address Verification

Always verify deposit addresses character by character. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, and funds sent to incorrect addresses cannot be recovered. Use the copy button provided rather than manually typing addresses. Consider sending a small test transaction for large deposits.

### Network Selection

Ensure you're depositing on the correct network. For example, USDC exists on multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Depositing to the wrong network may result in permanent loss. The platform clearly indicates which network each deposit address belongs to.

## Deposit Limits and Fees

### Minimum Deposits

Each cryptocurrency has minimum deposit requirements to ensure efficient processing:

| Currency | Minimum Deposit | Recommended First Deposit |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **SOL** | 0.1 SOL | 1-5 SOL |
| **USDC** | $10 | $100-500 |
| **BTC** | 0.0001 BTC | 0.001-0.01 BTC |
| **ETH** | 0.001 ETH | 0.01-0.1 ETH |

### Fee Structure

AssetSwap doesn't charge deposit fees. However, you'll pay standard network fees to the blockchain when sending funds. These fees vary based on network congestion and transaction priority. Always account for network fees when calculating deposit amounts.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Delayed Deposits

If your deposit doesn't appear within the expected timeframe, first check the transaction status on the relevant blockchain explorer. Verify you sent to the correct address and network. During high network congestion, confirmations may take longer than usual. Contact support with your transaction ID if delays exceed 2 hours.

### Missing Deposits

For deposits not showing after confirmation, ensure you used the correct network and included any required memos. Check if the amount meets minimum deposit requirements. Verify the deposit address matches what was provided. Our support team can investigate with your transaction details.

## Best Practices

Start with smaller test deposits to familiarize yourself with the process. Save frequently used deposit addresses in your secure password manager. Always double-check network selection before sending. Keep transaction IDs for reference and support queries. Monitor network congestion to optimize transaction fees.
