# Quick Start Guide

Get from zero to trading in under 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide. No prior crypto experience needed.

## Overview: Your Journey to Trading

Starting your crypto trading journey with MEME AI involves four simple steps: creating your account, funding your wallet, making your first trade, and optionally activating automated trading. Each step is designed for simplicity while maintaining security and control.

## Step 1: Account Creation (30 seconds)

### Getting Started

Navigate to [MEME AI](https://meme.assetswap.ai) and locate the prominent "Get Started" button on the homepage. The platform supports multiple sign-up methods to accommodate your preferences.

### Registration Options

Choose between email registration or Google authentication for instant access. Email registration requires verification for security, while Google sign-in provides immediate entry. Both methods create a secure, non-custodial wallet automatically, meaning you control your private keys.

### Automatic Wallet Generation

Upon successful registration, the platform generates your personal cryptocurrency wallet instantly. This wallet supports all major tokens and includes advanced security features. Your wallet address appears in your dashboard, ready to receive funds immediately.

## Step 2: Funding Your Account (2-3 minutes)

### Choosing Your Funding Method

The platform offers two primary funding options, each with distinct advantages:

| Method | Processing Time | Minimum | Best For |
|--------|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Card Payment** | 1-3 minutes | $50 | First-time users |
| **Crypto Transfer** | Instant-30 min | Varies | Existing crypto holders |

### Card Payment Process

Click the "ADD FUNDS WITH CARD" button prominently displayed in your wallet section. Enter your desired amount (minimum $50, recommended $100-200 for optimal flexibility). The secure payment processor handles card verification and compliance. Your funds convert automatically to USDC or SOL based on your preference. Most transactions complete within 1-3 minutes during business hours.

### Cryptocurrency Deposit

For users with existing crypto holdings, direct transfers offer the fastest funding method. Click "Deposit" and select your preferred cryptocurrency from the supported list. Copy the generated deposit address carefully, ensuring accuracy. Send funds from your external wallet or exchange. SOL transactions typically confirm within seconds, while other networks may take longer.

### Recommended Starting Amount

While $50 meets minimum requirements, starting with $100-200 provides better flexibility. This amount allows you to diversify across multiple tokens, test different features, and maintain reserves for opportunities. Remember to account for network fees, which typically range from $0.01-1.00 per transaction.

## Step 3: Your First Trade (1 minute)

### Understanding the AI Chat Interface

The AI chat serves as your primary trading interface, eliminating complex order forms. Simply type your trading intention in natural language, and the AI handles technical execution. The system understands various phrasings and provides clarification when needed.

### Making Your First Purchase

Start with a simple, clear command in the chat interface. Type something like "Buy $50 of BONK" or "Purchase $100 worth of WIF". The AI immediately processes your request and displays transaction details including:
- Exact token amount you'll receive
- Current market price
- Total cost including fees
- Estimated transaction time

### Confirming Your Trade

Review the presented details carefully before confirmation. The platform shows a clear breakdown of fees and final amounts. Click "Confirm" to execute the trade immediately. Your new tokens appear in your wallet within seconds. The AI provides a transaction summary and updates your portfolio automatically.

### Exploring Popular Commands

Expand your trading with these starter commands:

| Command | Purpose | Example Response |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| "What's trending?" | View hot tokens | Shows top 10 by volume |
| "Buy top performer" | Purchase best gainer | Buys today's #1 token |
| "Show new tokens" | Discover launches | Lists recent additions |
| "Check my balance" | Portfolio overview | Displays all holdings |

## Step 4: Automated Trading (Optional)

### Introducing Autopilot

Autopilot represents MEME AI's flagship automation feature, designed for hands-free portfolio growth. The system analyzes market conditions continuously, identifying opportunities that match your risk profile. Unlike traditional bots, Autopilot uses advanced AI to make contextual decisions.

### Activation Process

Locate the "Launch Autopilot" button in your dashboard's automation section. Configure your daily investment amount (minimum $50 recommended). Select your risk preference: Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive. Review the strategy summary explaining how your funds will be allocated. Click "Activate" to begin automated trading immediately.

### How Autopilot Works

The AI evaluates thousands of tokens every hour using proprietary scoring algorithms. It considers factors including momentum, safety scores, liquidity depth, and social sentiment. Trades execute automatically when optimal conditions align with your parameters. You receive notifications for each trade, maintaining complete transparency.

### Monitoring Performance

Track Autopilot's performance through the dedicated dashboard showing:
- Daily profit/loss percentages
- Token allocation breakdown  
- Trade history with rationale
- Cumulative returns graph

## Essential Tips for Success

### Starting Smart

Begin with smaller amounts to understand platform mechanics before scaling up. Test different features with minimal risk while learning the interface. Keep 20-30% of funds in reserve for manual opportunities. Document successful strategies for future reference.

### Risk Management

Never invest more than you can afford to lose in volatile markets. Diversify across 5-10 tokens rather than concentrating in one. Set mental stop-losses before entering positions. Use Autopilot's conservative mode initially, adjusting as you gain experience.

### Continuous Learning

The AI chat answers questions about trading concepts and strategies. Ask about specific tokens to receive detailed analysis. Request market updates for real-time insights. Explore educational resources in the help section.
