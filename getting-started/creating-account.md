## What Happens When You Create an Account

When you sign up, several things happen automatically. First, a Solana wallet (think of it as your digital money account) is created instantly for you. Second, a recovery phrase is generated - this is a special set of words that acts like a master key to your wallet, which you can use in other wallet apps if you want. You don't need to set up two-factor authentication (2FA - an extra security step using your phone), though you can add it later for more security. There's no complicated profile setup - everything is simple and straightforward. Once you add money to your account, you're ready to start trading right away.

## First Login

You'll see:
* Your new Solana wallet address
* $0 balance (add funds to start trading)
* AI chat assistant ready to help
* Recovery phrase export option in Settings

## Important: Recovery Phrase

When your account is created:
* A recovery phrase is automatically generated
* You can export this phrase to any wallet app
* Keep this phrase secure - it's the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access
* We don't store your recovery phrase - once lost, it cannot be recovered
