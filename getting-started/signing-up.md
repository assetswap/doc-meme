# Signing Up

Create your MEME AI account in minutes with no complex paperwork or lengthy verification processes. This guide walks you through each step of the registration process.

## Prerequisites for Account Creation

Before starting the signup process, ensure you have the following ready:

| Requirement | Purpose | Details |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Email Address** | Account verification | Any valid email you can access |
| **Mobile Phone** | Two-factor authentication | For receiving security codes |
| **5-10 Minutes** | Complete setup | Including wallet creation |
| **Initial Funds** | Start trading | $50-100 recommended (optional) |

## Step 1: Accessing the Platform

### Navigate to MEME AI

Open your preferred web browser and visit [meme.ai](https://meme.ai). The platform works on all modern browsers including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. Mobile browsers are fully supported for on-the-go access.

### Initiating Registration

Locate the prominent "Get Started" button on the homepage. This button appears in multiple locations for easy access. The registration page loads with a streamlined form designed for quick completion.

## Step 2: Account Creation Process

### Email Registration

Enter your email address in the designated field. This email becomes your primary account identifier and recovery method. Choose a strong, unique password following these guidelines:
- Minimum 8 characters length
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Add numbers and special characters
- Avoid common dictionary words

### Alternative Sign-Up Methods

The platform also supports social authentication for faster registration:

**Google Sign-In**: Click "Continue with Google" to use your existing Google account. This method eliminates password creation and speeds up the process.

**Apple ID**: iOS users can leverage Apple's secure authentication system. Face ID or Touch ID provides additional security layers.

### Privacy and Terms

Review the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before proceeding. These documents outline your rights, platform rules, and data handling practices. Checking the agreement box confirms your understanding and acceptance.

## Step 3: Email Verification

### Checking Your Inbox

After submitting the registration form, check your email within 5 minutes. Look for a message from "MEME AI" or "noreply@meme.ai". If not in your primary inbox, check spam or promotions folders.

### Verification Process

Click the verification link in the email to confirm your address. This link expires after 24 hours for security reasons. The link directs you back to MEME AI with your account activated. If the link expires, request a new one from the login page.

### Troubleshooting Verification

If you don't receive the email:
- Check all email folders including spam
- Verify you entered the correct email address
- Add meme.ai to your email whitelist
- Try the "Resend Email" option
- Contact support if issues persist

## Step 4: Wallet Configuration

### Understanding Wallet Options

MEME AI provides flexible wallet solutions to accommodate different user preferences and experience levels:

| Wallet Type | Best For | Key Features |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Built-in Wallet** | New users | Automatic creation, managed security |
| **External Wallet** | Experienced traders | Full control, existing holdings |
| **Hardware Wallet** | Maximum security | Cold storage, offline keys |

### Option A: Creating a New Wallet

For users new to cryptocurrency, the built-in wallet offers the simplest solution:

Click "Create New Wallet" to begin the generation process. The system creates a unique wallet address using industry-standard cryptographic methods. Your private keys remain encrypted and secure within the platform.

**Critical: Saving Your Recovery Phrase**

The system generates a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. This phrase is your master key to wallet recovery. Write it down on paper, never digitally. Store it in a secure location like a safe or safety deposit box. Never share this phrase with anyone, including support staff. Test your recovery phrase by re-entering it when prompted.

### Option B: Connecting an Existing Wallet

Experienced users can connect their existing Web3 wallets:

Click "Connect Wallet" to see supported wallet options. Popular choices include:
- **Phantom**: Optimized for Solana transactions
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- **Solflare**: Advanced Solana features
- **Trust Wallet**: Multi-chain mobile solution

Select your wallet from the list. Your wallet extension or app will prompt for connection approval. Review the permissions requested and approve if comfortable. The connection establishes read-only access initially.

### Security Best Practices

Enable two-factor authentication immediately after wallet setup. Use a unique, strong password different from other accounts. Never share private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Regularly backup your wallet information securely. Consider using a hardware wallet for large holdings.

## Step 5: Initial Funding

### Understanding SOL Requirements

Solana (SOL) serves as the network's native currency for transaction fees. Every trade, swap, or transfer requires a small amount of SOL for processing. These fees typically range from $0.001 to $0.01 per transaction.

### Minimum SOL Balance

Maintain at least 0.05 SOL ($5-10 worth) in your wallet for smooth operations. This amount covers approximately 500-1000 transactions. The platform warns you when SOL balance runs low.

### Adding SOL to Your Wallet

**Method 1: Direct Purchase**
Click "Buy SOL" to purchase with credit/debit card. Enter the USD amount you want to spend. Complete the secure checkout process. SOL appears in your wallet within minutes.

**Method 2: Transfer from Exchange**
Copy your wallet address from the dashboard. Log into your exchange account (Coinbase, Binance, etc.). Withdraw SOL to your MEME AI wallet address. Transactions confirm in under 30 seconds.

**Method 3: Swap Existing Tokens**
If you have other tokens, swap some for SOL. Type "swap [token] for SOL" in the chat. Maintain minimum SOL for future fees.
