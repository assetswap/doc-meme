# How MEME AI Scores Tokens

MEME AI analyzes every token with a 100-point scoring system. Here's exactly how we calculate each score.

## Overall Token Score

Your final score combines 6 key metrics:

| Metric | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Liquidity | 25% | Can you trade easily? |
| Activity | 20% | How active is trading? |
| Momentum | 20% | Is it trending up? |
| Community | 15% | How strong is the community? |
| Security | 15% | Is it safe? |
| Maturity | 5% | How established is it? |

## Activity Score (100 points)

Measures how much real trading is happening.

### What We Check

#### 1. Trading Volume (40% of score)
How many trades in different timeframes:
* **24 hour trades** (50% weight)
* **1 hour trades** (30% weight)  
* **4 hour trades** (20% weight)

**Scoring:**
* 100+ trades per period = Full points
* 50+ trades = Good score
* Less than 10 = Low score

#### 2. Unique Wallets (35% of score)
Different people trading (not just bots):
* **1000+ wallets** = 35 points (excellent)
* **500+ wallets** = 28 points (very good)
* **100+ wallets** = 20 points (good)
* **50+ wallets** = 10 points (okay)
* **Less than 50** = 5 points (poor)

#### 3. Buy/Sell Balance (25% of score)
Healthy mix of buying and selling:
* **40-60% buy ratio** = 25 points (perfect balance)
* **30-70% buy ratio** = 20 points (healthy)
* **20-80% buy ratio** = 15 points (acceptable)
* **Extreme ratios** = Red flag (manipulation risk)

## Maturity Score (100 points)

Shows how established and stable the token is.

### What We Check

#### 1. Market Cap Size (40% of score)
Bigger = more established:
* **$100M+** = 40 points (blue chip)
* **$50M+** = 35 points (established)
* **$10M+** = 30 points (mid-cap)
* **$1M+** = 20 points (small-cap)
* **Below $1M** = 10 points (micro-cap)

#### 2. Token Distribution (30% of score)
How spread out ownership is:

**Top 10 Holders:**
* **Less than 30%** = 15 points (excellent)
* **30-50%** = 10 points (good)
* **50-70%** = 5 points (risky)
* **Above 70%** = 0 points (dangerous)

**Top 100 Holders:**
* **Less than 80%** = 15 points (healthy)
* **Above 80%** = Lower score

#### 3. Supply Circulation (20% of score)
How much is actually trading:
* **90%+ circulating** = 20 points (fully diluted)
* **70-90%** = 15 points (mostly circulating)
* **50-70%** = 10 points (inflation risk)
* **Below 50%** = 5 points (high inflation risk)

#### 4. Holder Count (10% of score)
Size of community:
* **5000+ holders** = 10 points (large community)
