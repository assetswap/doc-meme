# Why Meme AI?

## The Challenge with Traditional Trading Tools

Traditional trading platforms were built for stocks and established cryptocurrencies, not meme coins. They rely on technical indicators that work for predictable markets but fail completely when applied to meme tokens. A meme coin can rise 1000% because of a single tweet or crash 90% when hype dies down. Traditional tools simply can't capture these dynamics.

Learn more about how we solve this in our [Token Scoring System](core-features/dashboard.md#token-scoring-system).

## Built Specifically for Meme Coins

MemeAI analyzes what actually drives meme coin prices. Instead of using outdated price charts, we track social sentiment, influencer activity, holder quality, and community growth. Our AI understands the difference between genuine community excitement and artificial pumping schemes.

See how our [AI Chat Assistant](core-features/ai-chat.md) interprets these signals to help you trade.

## 24/7 Automation That Never Sleeps

Meme coin markets never sleep - they run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. While you're working, sleeping, or spending time with family, opportunities come and go. MemeAI's automation features work around the clock for you. Here's what you can do:

You can tell the AI to automatically buy the best-performing tokens each day with a set amount like $50. The system can monitor your portfolio (your collection of tokens) and automatically sell if the liquidity drops (liquidity is the amount of money available for trading - when it drops significantly, it might mean the project is failing). This helps protect you from "rug pulls" (when creators abandon a project and take the money). The AI can also exit your positions if it detects warning signs like more people selling than buying, or if our scoring system shows the token is becoming risky.

Explore our [Autopilot features](automation/autopilot.md) to set up your automated strategies.
