# Documentation Guidelines for Meme AI User Guide

This file contains the guidelines for writing and updating the user documentation for the Meme AI platform.

## Core Principles

1. **Write for Complete Beginners**: Assume users have no prior technical knowledge. Every technical term must be explained when used, every time it appears.

2. **Keep It Simple**: Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary, and always provide explanations.

3. **Logical Flow**: Structure content from broad concepts to specific details. Start with the big picture before diving into specifics.

4. **Manageable Page Length**: Keep individual pages concise. If content becomes too long, organize it into folders and subpages for easier navigation.

5. **Formatting Preferences**: 
   - Use complete sentences rather than excessive bullet points
   - Employ tables for complex comparisons or multi-dimensional information
   - Write in paragraph form when explaining concepts

6. **Avoid Redundancy**: 
   - Never duplicate content across pages
   - Link to existing pages rather than repeating information
   - Each topic should have a single authoritative location
   - If content exists elsewhere, use a brief summary and link to the full page

7. **Content Organization**:
   - Avoid repeating similar sections (e.g., "Who Can Use" and "Who is it For")
   - Maintain clear hierarchy without circular references
   - Ensure logical progression without backtracking to similar topics

## Document Structure

- Begin each section with an overview
- Progress from general to specific information
- Break complex topics into digestible sections
- Use clear headings for navigation

## Remember

The goal is to help users understand how to use the platform effectively, regardless of their technical background. Every piece of documentation should be accessible, clear, and helpful.
