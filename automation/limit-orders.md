# Smart Limit Orders

Automated trading that monitors your positions 24/7 and executes trades when your specified conditions are met. MEME AI's intelligent limit orders go beyond simple price triggers to include comprehensive market analysis.

## Understanding Smart Limit Orders

Smart limit orders are like setting automatic rules for your trades that work even when you're sleeping. Think of them as instructions you give to the platform: "If this happens, do that." For example, a take-profit order automatically sells your tokens when they reach your target price (securing your gains), while a stop-loss order sells if the price drops too much (limiting your losses). What makes our orders "smart" is that they don't just watch the price - they monitor over 30 different things about each token, like how safe it is, who's buying and selling, and how easy it is to trade.

## Getting Started with Limit Orders

Setting up your first limit order takes less than a minute. Navigate to your wallet and select any token you hold. Click the "Set Limit Order" button to open the configuration panel. Choose your monitoring metric (price, safety score, volume, etc.) and set your target threshold. Once confirmed, the order becomes active immediately and runs continuously until triggered or cancelled.

## Comprehensive Monitoring Options

### Price-Based Triggers

Configure orders based on specific price targets or percentage changes from your entry point. Set multiple price levels to scale out of positions gradually. For example, create an order to "Sell 50% when BONK reaches $0.001 and the remainder at $0.0015."

### Safety Score Protection

The platform's proprietary safety score analyzes multiple risk factors including liquidity depth, holder distribution, and contract security. Set automatic exits when safety metrics deteriorate, protecting your capital from potential rug pulls or market manipulation.

### Whale Movement Detection

Whales are people or groups with huge amounts of tokens - when they buy or sell, it can move the entire market. Our system watches these big players for you. You can set up automatic trades that react when whales start buying (often a good sign) or selling (often a warning sign). This helps you follow the smart money or get out before a big price drop.

### Volume and Liquidity Analysis

React to changing market conditions by monitoring trading volume and liquidity metrics. Set orders to execute when volume spikes indicate renewed interest or when declining liquidity suggests reduced market support.

## Recommended Trading Strategies

### Beginner Strategy: Foundation Protection

If you're new to trading, start simple. Set your tokens to automatically sell for profit when they go up 50% (meaning if you bought $100 worth, it sells when it's worth $150). Also set a safety net to sell if they drop 20% (if your $100 drops to $80, it sells to prevent bigger losses). This balanced approach helps you lock in wins and prevent big losses while you're learning how the market works.

### Intermediate Strategy: Scaled Exits

Implement multi-level profit taking to maximize gains while reducing risk. Take 50% profits at 100% gain to recoup your initial investment. Sell the remaining position at 200% gain for maximum upside. Add a safety score trigger below 40 to protect against token-specific risks beyond price.

### Advanced Strategy: Multi-Metric Protection

Combine price, safety, volume, and whale metrics for comprehensive coverage. Details available in our [Advanced Strategies](limit-orders-strategies.md) guide.
