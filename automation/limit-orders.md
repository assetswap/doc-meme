# Smart Limit Orders

Set it and forget it. MEME AI watches your tokens 24/7 and trades automatically when your conditions are met.

## What Are They?

Think of limit orders like alarms for your crypto:
* **Take Profit** = Sell when things go well
* **Stop Loss** = Sell when things go bad

But MEME AI watches more than just price. We monitor 30+ metrics so you can trade smarter.

## Quick Start

1. Go to **Wallet**
2. Click any token
3. Choose **"Set Limit Order"**
4. Pick what to watch (price, safety, etc.)
5. Set your target
6. Done! We handle the rest

## What Can You Monitor?

### 📈 Price
* Set exact prices or percentages
* Example: "Sell if BONK hits $0.001"

### 🛡️ Safety Score
* Exit if token becomes risky
* Example: "Sell if safety drops below 50"

### 🐋 Whale Activity
* Track big players
* Example: "Sell if whales dump"
