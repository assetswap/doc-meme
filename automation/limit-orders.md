# Smart Limit Orders

Automated trading that monitors your positions 24/7 and executes trades when your specified conditions are met. MEME AI's intelligent limit orders go beyond simple price triggers to include comprehensive market analysis.

## Understanding Smart Limit Orders

Smart limit orders function as automated trading guardians for your portfolio. Take-profit orders automatically secure gains when targets are reached, while stop-loss orders protect against excessive losses. Unlike traditional limit orders that only watch price, MEME AI monitors over 30 different market metrics to make more informed trading decisions.

## Getting Started with Limit Orders

Setting up your first limit order takes less than a minute. Navigate to your wallet and select any token you hold. Click the "Set Limit Order" button to open the configuration panel. Choose your monitoring metric (price, safety score, volume, etc.) and set your target threshold. Once confirmed, the order becomes active immediately and runs continuously until triggered or cancelled.

## Comprehensive Monitoring Options

### Price-Based Triggers

Configure orders based on specific price targets or percentage changes from your entry point. Set multiple price levels to scale out of positions gradually. For example, create an order to "Sell 50% when BONK reaches $0.001 and the remainder at $0.0015."

### Safety Score Protection

The platform's proprietary safety score analyzes multiple risk factors including liquidity depth, holder distribution, and contract security. Set automatic exits when safety metrics deteriorate, protecting your capital from potential rug pulls or market manipulation.

### Whale Movement Detection

Monitor large holder activity to anticipate major market moves. Configure alerts and automatic trades based on whale accumulation or distribution patterns. This feature helps you follow smart money or exit before significant dumps.

### Volume and Liquidity Analysis

React to changing market conditions by monitoring trading volume and liquidity metrics. Set orders to execute when volume spikes indicate renewed interest or when declining liquidity suggests reduced market support.

## Recommended Trading Strategies

### Beginner Strategy: Foundation Protection

Start with simple profit-taking at 50% gains and loss prevention at 20% downside. This balanced approach secures wins while limiting losses to manageable levels. Perfect for new traders learning market dynamics.

### Intermediate Strategy: Scaled Exits

Implement multi-level profit taking to maximize gains while reducing risk. Take 50% profits at 100% gain to recoup your initial investment. Sell the remaining position at 200% gain for maximum upside. Add a safety score trigger below 40 to protect against token-specific risks beyond price.

### Advanced Strategy: Multi-Metric Protection

Combine price, safety, volume, and whale metrics for comprehensive coverage. Details available in our [Advanced Strategies](limit-orders-strategies.md) guide.
