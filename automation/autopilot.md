# Autopilot Mode

Autopilot is an intelligent automation tool designed to get you started trading in seconds. It handles the complex tasks of researching, analyzing, and trading tokens while you focus on other things.

## What is Autopilot?

Autopilot is your personal trading assistant that works 24/7. It automatically buys the best tokens every day with your specified amount, monitors your portfolio constantly to check if tokens are performing well, and protects you against losses by exiting positions when necessary. Think of it as having an expert trader working for you around the clock, making decisions based on real-time data and proven strategies.

## How It Works

When you activate Autopilot, it creates simple starter tasks that appear in your Task Dashboard. These tasks run automatically - for example, buying the best-scoring tokens daily with $50, or checking your portfolio every hour to ensure your tokens maintain good scores and adequate liquidity. The beauty is that these are just starting points. You can edit these tasks later to match your exact preferences, add new conditions, or create more sophisticated strategies as you become more comfortable with the platform.
