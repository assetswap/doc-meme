# Setting Up Limit Orders

Step-by-step guide to creating your first order.

### Take Profit (TP)
Sell when things go well:

### Stop Loss (SL)  
Sell when things go bad:

## Step 4: Pick What to Watch

### For Beginners: Price

* Stop Loss: $0.0008 (20% loss)

### For Safety: Security Score
1. Select **"Security Score"**
2. Choose **"Below"**
3. Set to **40** (exit if unsafe)

### For Trends: Momentum
1. Select **"Momentum Score"**
2. Choose **"Above"** for profits
3. Set to **80** (sell at peak)

## Step 5: Set Amount

Choose how much to sell:

* **50%** - Sell half
* **Custom** - Pick amount

## Tips

### Setting Good Triggers

* Price moves 10% daily
* Scores change 5-10 points
* Give room to breathe

**Too Far = Useless**
* May never trigger
* Miss opportunities
* Waste of order

**Just Right**
* Price: 20-50% moves
* Scores: 15-20 point changes
* Based on token volatility

### Common Mistakes
