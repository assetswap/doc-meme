# Welcome to MEME AI

MEME AI is your intelligent companion for trading meme tokens on Solana. Built specifically for meme coin trading, it provides AI assistance, automation, and real-time analysis that traditional trading tools can't match.

## Why Choose MemeAI?

> **Want the full story?** Read our detailed explanation in [Why Meme AI?](why-meme-ai.md)

Traditional trading tools weren't built for meme coins. While most traders use price charts with indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index - a tool that measures if something is being bought or sold too much), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence - a tool that tracks price trends), or momentum indicators, these don't work well for meme coins. Why? Because meme coin prices move based on social media posts, influencer tweets, community hype, and viral news rather than traditional market patterns. When an RSI indicator says a coin is "overbought" (meaning too many people are buying), it doesn't mean the price will stop rising in the meme coin world.

Learn how our [Token Scoring System](core-features/dashboard.md#token-scoring-system) addresses these unique challenges.

## What Makes MemeAI Different?

Instead of using outdated technical indicators, we analyze what really matters for meme coins. We look at the actual holders of each token (the people who own it). For instance, we check how many people hold the token and whether these are experienced traders with large wallets who consistently make profits, or smaller investors who might be following risky advice from influencers.

Our team collects data from both the blockchain (on-chain data - the public record of all transactions) and social media platforms (off-chain data - tweets, posts, and community discussions). We use all this information to train our AI specifically for meme coin trading, making it smarter and more accurate than generic trading tools. See it in action on our [Dashboard](core-features/dashboard.md).

## Why Automation Matters

Meme coin markets never sleep - they run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. While you're working, sleeping, or spending time with family, opportunities come and go. MemeAI's automation features work around the clock for you. 

The AI can automatically buy the best-performing tokens each day with a set amount like $50. The system monitors your [portfolio](core-features/portfolio.md) and automatically sells if the liquidity drops (liquidity is the amount of money available for trading - when it drops significantly, it might mean the project is failing). This helps protect you from "rug pulls" (when creators abandon a project and take the money). The AI also exits your positions if it detects warning signs like more people selling than buying, or if our scoring system shows the token is becoming risky.

Set up these features with [Autopilot Mode](automation/autopilot.md) and [Scheduled Tasks](automation/scheduled-tasks.md).
