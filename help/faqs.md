## Account & Wallet

### How do I fund my wallet?

2. Crypto transfer (free, instant)

### Can I use my existing wallet?

## Trading

### How do I buy tokens?
Three ways:
1. Chat: "Buy $100 of BONK"
2. Market tab: Browse and click trade
3. Swap widget: Manual swap interface

### What is slippage?
Slippage is the price difference between order and execution. Set 1-2% for most tokens, higher for new/volatile ones.

### Why did my trade fail?
Common reasons:
- Insufficient SOL for fees
- Slippage too low
- Token liquidity issues
- Network congestion

### Can I cancel a trade?
No. Blockchain transactions are final once executed. Always review before confirming.

## Autopilot

### What is Autopilot?
Autopilot is our automated trading strategy that buys top tokens daily and sells underperformers, targeting 15-30% monthly returns.

### How much does Autopilot cost?
No extra fees! Just the standard 1% trading fee on executed trades.

### Can I stop Autopilot?
Yes, pause or stop anytime. Your positions remain, no new trades execute.

### What returns can I expect?
Historical average: 15-30% monthly. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Crypto is volatile.

## Tasks & Automation

### What are tasks?
Tasks are scheduled trading actions that run automatically - like buying daily, taking profits, or stop losses.

### How many tasks can I create?
Up to 50 active tasks. Most users need 5-10.
