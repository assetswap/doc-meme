## Accessing Security Settings

1. Click the **Settings** icon (⚙️)
2. Select **Security** from the menu
3. Manage your security options

## Private Key Management

### Exporting Your Private Key

Your private key is like the master password to your digital wallet - it gives complete control over all your funds. Think of it as the key to a safe that contains all your cryptocurrencies. You should export (save) it to create a backup copy in case you lose access to your account, to use your wallet in other apps, or to access your funds from different devices.

**Steps to Export:**
1. Go to Security Settings
2. Click **"Export Private Key"**
3. Complete security verification
4. Click **"Reveal Private Key"**
5. Copy and store securely
6. Never share with anyone

### Security Warning
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Your private key is the most important piece of information for your wallet. It's like having the actual key to a physical safe - anyone who has it can open the safe and take everything inside. MEME AI staff will NEVER ask you for your private key, not even for support. If someone asks for it, they are trying to steal from you. Store your private key offline (written on paper or saved on a USB drive that's not connected to the internet) in multiple safe places like a home safe or bank deposit box.

### Challenge Account Restrictions
If you received free challenge funds:
- Private key is initially locked
- Unlock by paying 50x the challenge amount
- Alternative: Create new account with own funds
- This protects against challenge abuse

## API Key Management

### Your API Key
An API key is a special code that lets other programs or tools connect to your MEME AI account (API stands for Application Programming Interface - it's how different software programs talk to each other). Your API key is unique to your account, like a special access card. It lets you connect trading bots or other tools to your account. For security, there's a limit on how many times it can be used per minute (rate-limited). You can cancel it anytime if you think someone else might have gotten access to it.

**Managing API Keys:**
1. Click **"Generate API Key"**
2. Copy the key immediately
3. Store securely
4. Never commit to code repositories

**API Key Features:**
- Read-only or full access
- IP whitelist option
- Expiration dates
- Usage tracking

### Revoking Access
If your API key is compromised:
1. Click **"Revoke API Key"**
2. Generate new key if needed
3. Update all integrations
4. Review recent activity

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Setting Up 2FA (Optional)
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. It's like having two locks on your door instead of one. Even if someone gets your password, they still need a second code from your phone to get in. While it's optional, we strongly recommend using it:

1. Click **"Enable 2FA"**
2. Scan QR code with authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - 1Password
   - Microsoft Authenticator
3. Enter verification code
4. Save backup codes safely

### Backup Codes
- 10 single-use codes provided
- Store separately from password
- Each works once only
- Regenerate when low

### Disable 2FA
1. Enter current 2FA code
2. Confirm removal
3. Re-enable anytime

## Recovery Options

### Account Recovery
Set up recovery methods:
- **Recovery Email**: Backup email address
- **Security Questions**: 3 questions minimum
- **Recovery Phrase**: Your wallet seed phrase

### What If I Lose Access?

**With Recovery Setup:**
1. Click "Can't access account?"
2. Choose recovery method
3. Verify identity
4. Reset credentials

**Without Recovery Setup:**
- Email-based accounts: Use email reset
- Google accounts: Use Google recovery
- Wallet funds: Lost forever without private key
