Here’s a clean draft you can send to your dev to update the user documentation:

Hi [Dev],

For tonight’s documentation changes, here’s what I’d like updated:

Page: Welcome to MemeAI

I want to expand the explanation of the flow and why we created MemeAI:
• Why MemeAI?
In today’s crypto market, most traders rely on trading charts with price-based indicators like RSI, MACD, or momentum. These tools are outdated and not suitable for crypto, especially for MemeCoins such as OpenCoin. The reason is simple: these markets react to tweets, influencers, hype, and fake news. An overbought RSI doesn’t mean the price will stop going up, and vice versa.
• What tools are suitable?
Instead of outdated technical indicators, we analyze the real fundamentals of MemeCoins. For example, we look at the holders of the token.
• How many holders are there?
• Are they large wallets consistently making profits, or small wallets that get scammed by influencers and marketers?
Our team, Real Attack Eonshade, spends its time collecting all possible on-chain and off-chain data to train an ultra-specialized AI model for MemeCoin trading.
• Why automation?
MemeCoin markets are 24/7. If you have a job, a business, or simply need to sleep, you’ll miss opportunities. MemeAI solves this with automations. For example:
• Tell the AI to buy the best tokens daily with $50.
• Automatically check your portfolio and sell tokens if liquidity drops by $200K, preventing rug pulls.
• Exit positions if sell pressure exceeds buy pressure or if the score declines.
• Who is it for?
• Beginners: Easy to buy and manage MemeCoins with Eonshade.
• Advanced traders: Access to powerful automations for deeper strategies.

This section should clearly show that MemeAI is a new generation of trading tools built for MemeCoin markets, with both simplicity and advanced features.

Hi [Dev],

Here are the additional changes I need for the user documentation:

Account Creation
• Options: VAPS shows email and Google sign-up.
• When a user creates an account, it automatically generates a wallet.
• A recovery phrase is generated and can be exported into their favorite application.
• No 2FA required.
• No need for a user profile section.

Notifications
• Check all possible notification types.
• Create a dedicated section in the documentation for Notifications.
• Add a table listing all alerts with a short description of what each alert means.

Troubleshooting
• Remove this section completely (not useful).

Wallet Section
• Create a dedicated section about adding funds to the wallet.

Private Key
• Clarify that if the user participated in the challenge and we added funds to their balance:
• The private key will not be visible.
• To unlock, they must pay 50x the amount we added to the balance.
• If they want an unlimited account, they need to add their own funds (not use challenge funds).
• It’s not a wallet that can be modified (remove the misleading FAQ part).
• If they lose access, the wallet is lost — we don’t have access to the private key.

Here’s a clean draft you can pass to your dev for the King of Thirst raid section update:

⸻

Hi [Dev],

Next, for the King of Thirst raid part of the documentation, please update as follows:

Content Changes
• Remove the part about sole transactions of girls → clarify that we finance them if they don’t have a sole.
• Remove mentions of network fee.
• Remove mentions of slippage.
• For Method 2 (Market Discovery):
• Users can simply drag and drop the token into the chat to buy it.
• Remove the Trade button.

New Dedicated Pages

Create new dedicated documentation pages for clarity: 1. Methods → each method should have its own dedicated page (with explanation and flow). 2. Fees → explain what fees exist (separated from main flow). 3. Tips → best practices, hints, and guidance. 4. Troubleshooting Errors & Mistakes → dedicated page with common errors and how to solve them.

Here’s a clear draft you can send to your dev for the Featured Trading & related sections update:

⸻

Hi [Dev],

Please update the Featured Trading and related pages as follows:

Featured Trading
• Trading page: remove it (currently empty).
• Trading Discovery page: replace with a Dashboard explanation:
• Dashboard shows the list of tokens and their scores.
• Add explanation of how tokens are scored.
• Add a Chat History section:
• Explain that Chat History automatically shows if a chat led to a transaction.
• Indicate whether the chat came from automation or manual mode.
• If there was a transaction, display the amount traded.

Analytics & Automation
• Move the Analytics section so it comes before the Automation section.

Other Pages
• Staking: currently empty → leave it empty or hide until later.
• Trading History: fill this section by pointing to Dashboard → Trading History, which shows all wallet transactions.
• Profit and Loss: remove this section completely (not needed).

⸻

Here’s a clear draft you can send to your dev for the Settings & Automation documentation updates:

⸻

Hi [Dev],

Please update the Settings and Automation sections as follows:

Settings Section

Currently all pages are empty. Update to show the full Settings page with the following:
• Notifications → include the list/table of possible alerts (reuse the notifications table created earlier).
• Security → include export of PrivateKey and AptKey.
• Stats → display user stats relevant to their account.
• Rewards & Referral Program → create a dedicated subsection explaining how rewards work and how referrals are tracked.

Automation Section
• Explain that Automation is an Autopilot tool designed to get users started in seconds.
• Describe in sentences (not bullets) what it does: for example, it can automatically buy the best tokens every day with $50, or check the portfolio to see if the tokens are good and protect against losses.
• Emphasize that these are simple starter tasks, displayed in the Task Dashboard, where users can edit them later.
• Add a recommendation line: users should test more tasks, since the default setup is just a simple starting point.
• Remove the Autopilot page itself (not needed).
• Remove the Problem page.
• Remove the Task Schedule page (too detailed, unnecessary).
• Task Template page → keep this one. Pull the list of templates directly from the app, and explain each template with a clear example in detail.

Do you want me to also draft the Rewards & Referral Program section text (with example flow: invite → track referral → earn rewards) so your dev doesn’t have to guess the content?
